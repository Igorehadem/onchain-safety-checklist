## Wallet Safety Best Practices

- Always use hardware wallets for holding main funds.
- Keep private keys offline and never share seed phrases.
- Verify all contract interactions in Etherscan/BaseScan before signing.
- Use different wallets for testing, development, and mainnet funds.
- Revoke dApp permissions regularly using revoke.cash or similar tools.
- Double-check addresses when transferring assets â€” phishing domains often differ by one symbol.
- Enable passphrases and two-factor authentication where supported.
